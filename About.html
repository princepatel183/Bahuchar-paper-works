        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <P>A disposable (also called disposable product) is a product designed for a single use after which it is recycled or is disposed as solid waste. Disposable products are those products which are meant for a single use and after that they are recycled for reuse. The term often implies economical and ease of use rather than medium to long-term durability. Disposables are most often made from paper, plastic, cotton, or polystyrene foam. Examples of disposables are-Disposable dishware / drink ware (e.g. plates, bowls, cups), Plastic cutlery (e.g. spoons, knives, forks, sporks), Disposable table cloth, Cans, bottles, jars, cartons, wrappers and other food packaging are largely recyclable, and some are even compostable, Inexpensive Tupperware products are recyclable, Cupcake wrappers, coffee filters are compostable.The term often implies cheapness and short-term convenience rather than medium to long-term durability. The term is also sometimes used for products that may last several months (e.g. disposable air filters) to distinguish from similar products that last indefinitely (e.g. washable air filters). The word “disposables” is not to be confused with the word “consumables” which is widely used in the mechanical world. In welding for example, welding rods, tips, nozzles, gas, etc. are considered to be “consumables” as they only last a certain amount of time before needing to be replaced.</P>
